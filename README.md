# TableCheck SWE Fullstack Take-Home Assignment

Remote Waitlist Manager is a full-stack application designed to handle the waitlist of your restaurant. It manages seating, queueing, and notifications for your diners. **Multiple parties** should be able to join your restaurant's waitlist **concurrently**. Instead of waiting in line to write your name on a piece of paper, you can now join the waitlist virtually and get notified when your table is ready. This will increase your restaurant's efficiency and provide a better experience for your customers.

The user flow is as follows:

- A party of diners go to their favorite restaurant. It's fully booked, but the restaurant gives the option to join a virtual waitlist accessible via browser.
- When the diner opens the app they're asked to input their name and party size.
- After joining the waitlist, they can check the app to verify if it's their turn.
- When the table is ready for them, they check-in via the app and get seated.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

Our current tech stack uses ReactJS, TypeScript and isomorphic SSR, but you shouldn’t be limited to that. If you feel more proficient with a different stack, just go for it! Feel free to use a SPA, islands, traditional SSR, vue, angular, ember, vanilla JS, etc.

### Backend

Similarly, while our stack uses Ruby on Rails with MongoDB, you’re free to use any mainstream language/framework and storage.

Whatever database you decide to use, it should be runnable with a simple `docker compose up`.

## Business Requirements

**Restaurant Capacity**

Hardcoded to 10 seats.

**Service Time Calculation**

Hardcoded to 3 seconds per person. Example: A party of 4 takes 12 seconds to complete the service.

**Joining the waitlist**

The diner opens the app that shows a single form with these form elements:

1. Name input (text)
2. Party size input (number)
3. Submit button. When clicked, the party is added to the waitlist queue.

**Checking in and starting the service**

When the queued party is ready to begin service, the app should display a "check in" button. When clicked:

- The party is removed from the waitlist queue.
- The number of seats available should be increased by the party size.
- The service countdown starts for that party.

Importantly, the user _must_ be able to view the state of their queued party across multiple browser sessions.

**Queue management**

When a party completes service:

- The system checks the queue for the next party.
- If the seats available are enough for the next party size, the next party’s app shows a new “Check-in” button.
- If not, wait until enough seats are available.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a public GitHub repository for your project.
2. Include this README in your repository, with clear instructions for setting up and running the project locally.
3. Include a brief explanation of your architecture decisions in the README or a separate document.

Please grant access to your repo for these following github users

`lerio` - Valerio Donati, VPoE at TableCheck
`daniellizik` - Daniel Lizik, Engineering Manager at TableCheck
`akashgupta-tc` - Akash Gupta, Associate Engineering Manager at TableCheck

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

1. Functionality: Does the application work as specified?
2. Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable? Add sufficient comments in places where you think it would help other contributors to onboard more quickly to understand your code.
3. Architecture: Are there clear separations of concerns and good design patterns used?
4. Customer Focus: Is the user experience intuitive? Would _you_ use this application if you were a diner? _Please_ play around with your app as if you were a customer prior to submission.
5. QA: Are you confident in the quality of your product? If you had to refactor or add new features, would you be able to do so without breaking the existing functionality? There is no guideline on how many tests you should write, what type of tests you should write, what level of coverage you need to achieve, etc. We leave it to you to decide how to ensure a level of quality that results in your customers trusting your product.

### Good luck!
